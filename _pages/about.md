About
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of International Economics, Government and Business, Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/department-international-economics-government-and-business-egb), on the Ty­coon Can­did­ates project led by Mogens K. Justesen. I am also a postdoctoral research affiliate at the [Center for Social Media, AI, and Politics (CSMAP) at New York University](https://csmapnyu.org/). I received my PhD degree in November 2024 from the [Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/).

My research is based at the intersection of comparative politics, political communication, and computational social sciences. My ongoing work combines computational methods with causal inference to examine how political expression and self-censorship among societal actors are shaped by different informational environments, both online and offline. My dissertation focused on autocratic use of in­form­a­tion con­trol and its im­plic­a­tions for political expression on digital and tra­di­tion­al me­dia plat­forms, with a fo­cus on Rus­sia. 

I primarily employ quant­it­at­ive and com­pu­ta­tion­al meth­ods in my work – drawing on large-scale (digital) data, a variety of NLP and LLM approaches, and combining descriptive analyses with quasi-experimental designs.

    This research note investigates the aftermath of YouTube’s global ban on Russian state-affiliated media channels in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Using over 12 million YouTube comments across 40 Russian-language channels, we analyzed the effectiveness of the ban and the shifts in user activity before and after the platform’s intervention. We found that YouTube, in accordance with its promise, effectively removed user activity across the banned channels. However, the ban did not prevent users from seeking out ideologically similar content on other channels and, in turn, increased user engagement on otherwise less visible pro-Kremlin channels. </em></small>

    <small><em> Autocrats understand the dangers of an informed citizenry and invest heavily in
    strategies to manipulate and restrict the media landscape, whether through overt repression
    or more subtle tactics. This paper exploits a 2016 reform of regional television
    in Russia to examine how autocrats use indirect leverage to shape the media environment.
    Using a differences-in-differences design and an original dataset of local news
    broadcasts from across Russia, I estimate the effects of winning and participating in
    regime-sponsored tenders on pro-regime bias in news content. I find that winners
    increased pro-regime bias in their news coverage, particularly companies operating
    in more competitive local markets. I also present descriptive evidence that outlets increased
    bias at the onset of the tender, though these patterns are not statistically robust
    across specifications. These findings highlight how autocrats can utilize bureaucratic
    tools to create long-term incentives for favorable news coverage, without incurring
    the costs of overt repression. </em></small>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small><em> Social media has become a crucial arena for political opposition in autocracies,
    and, in turn, autocrats have adapted by introducing costly barriers to deter citizens
    from political engagement online. Still, little is known about the differential effect of
    repression on those targeted by the repression versus those observing it. We exploit the
    temporal variation in Russian “foreign agent” labeling to investigate how repression
    impacts political expression online in (1) the content produced by those labeled as
    political pariahs, and (2) the user engagement with the “suspect” content. To do this,
    we employ a staggered difference-in-differences design on videos posted by YouTubers
    designated as “foreign agents” in Russia (>200,000 videos), and the adjacent comments
    left by viewers (>130,000,000 comments). Our findings suggest that targeted actors not
    only retain their online presence but also increase the level of regime criticism in their
    content. Simultaneously, we show that audience engagement dropped substantially
    among actors branded as politically deviant by the regime. Finally, users appear
    to increase the use of symbols when engaging with targeted channels. These results
    indicate that regime deterrence signals can be effective in stifling online engagement
    with politically sensitive content, but may inadvertently foster political dissent that
    eludes easy detection by the regime. These findings have important implications for
    understanding the limitations of digital technologies as tools for authoritarian regimes
    on the one hand, as well as for pro-democratic movements on the other.</em></small>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small><em> The implications of censorship are often boiled down to two overall mechanisms
    by scholars: either the regime succeeds in silencing dissent or will endure the cost
    of backfire in the form of circumvention or public backlash. Much existing scholarship
    debates the contextual characteristics and settings in which each mechanism
    prevails. This paper analyzes how overt and repressive censorship shapes online discourse
    in times of political unrest. Using Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and
    subsequent authoritarian consolidation as a case, this paper studies over 4,500,000
    comments across different pro and anti-regime-leaning YouTube channels targeted
    toward Russian-speaking audiences. I use an embedding-based topic model to conduct
    a descriptive analysis of changes in online discourse in the days following the
    invasion as well as the introduction of Russia’s censorship law in March 2022. The
    results suggest that discourse on collective action nearly doubled at the start of the invasion.
    However, both discourse on collective action and criticism of the war sharply
    dropped as the law was introduced. In sum, the findings indicate that Russia’s invasion
    of Ukraine initially triggered (online) backlash but that the regime swiftly curtailed
    the dissent through the implementation of overt and repressive censorship.
    This showcases how regimes can successfully balance sparks of unrest by doubling
    down on repression. In light of the findings, the paper contributes to the theoretical
    discussion on the complicated dynamics of backlash and deterrence. It demonstrates
    how the impermanent nature of backlash patterns can make the associated
    costs worthwhile for autocrats hoping to reduce long-term risks.</em></small>
