  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  Social media has become a crucial arena for political opposition in autocracies,
and, in turn, autocrats have adapted by introducing costly barriers to deter citizens
from political engagement online. Still, little is known about the differential effect of
repression on those targeted by the repression versus those observing it. We exploit the
temporal variation in Russian “foreign agent” labeling to investigate how repression
impacts political expression online in (1) the content produced by those labeled as
political pariahs, and (2) the user engagement with the “suspect” content. To do this,
we employ a staggered difference-in-differences design on videos posted by YouTubers
designated as “foreign agents” in Russia (>200,000 videos), and the adjacent comments
left by viewers (>130,000,000 comments). Our findings suggest that targeted actors not
only retain their online presence but also increase the level of regime criticism in their
content. Simultaneously, we show that audience engagement dropped substantially
among actors branded as politically deviant by the regime. Finally, users appear
to increase the use of symbols when engaging with targeted channels. These results
indicate that regime deterrence signals can be effective in stifling online engagement
with politically sensitive content, but may inadvertently foster political dissent that
eludes easy detection by the regime. These findings have important implications for
understanding the limitations of digital technologies as tools for authoritarian regimes
on the one hand, as well as for pro-democratic movements on the other.
